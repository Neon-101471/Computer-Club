            <p>MIST Computer Club is one of the finest clubs of MIST that is supervised by our experienced, cooperative and so many helpful faculty members. Their guidance and support help us, students, a lot to enrich our club and hopefully we will do more good deeds in  the future. Here we will discuss the activities we are performing and our future plans for the club. </p>

            <p>MCC mainly focuses on contest programming and grooming students for competitive and professional programming. This year we were extremely proud to host the National Collegiate Programming Contest (NCPC 2020), the flagship programming contest in Bangladesh with participation from 77 universities. While we continue our focus on contest programming, recently, under the guidance of our respected head sir and advisor of the club, we are diversifying the scopes of MCC. We are venturing various open courses and workshops, developing various multi-dimensional projects through the newly established MCC R&D wing. We are currently conducting an Introductory Web Development Course, which is open for all students from any department of MIST.  We plan to conduct such open courses and workshops in the future as well, on an even bigger scale. </p>

            <p>In short, currently the regular activities of MCC can be categorized to-</p>

            <h4 className='text-success'>Contest Programming Classes:</h4>

            <p>We regularly hold weekly programming classes for programmers of MIST. Programmers are classes into beginner and advanced. Mr. Tanzir, a renowned coach for contest programming currently serves as the mentor for the advanced programmers. During COVID-19 lockdown, we're still taking all classes online with over 95% participation.</p>

            <h4 className='text-success'>Contest Programming:</h4>

            <p>On top of the classes, we also arrange programming contests both online and on-site. They help to improve the programming and problem solving skills of the students drastically.</p>

            <h4 className='text-success'>Development Courses and Workshops:</h4>

            <p>We are also diversifying our field from contest programming and conducting courses on software development. Currently Web development course, with 124 registered students is going on.</p>

            <h4 className='text-success'>MCC R&D:</h4>

            <p>As very recently established, we plan on using this wing to solve real life , impactful, project-based problems. The currently ongoing projects are listed here.</p>

            <h4  className='text-success'>Events and Competitions:</h4>

            <p>We also host contest programming events regularly. We hosted 1st MIST IUPC in 2019 with participation from 55 universities and hosted the prestigious NCPC 2020 with participation from 77 universities which garnered widespread publicity in print and televised media.

            <h4 className='text-success'>Ongoing Courses:</h4>

            <p>Under the supervision of the faculty members, the ongoing course that MCC is performing now:</p>

            <p>1. Basic C Programming Course for Beginners <br />
                2. Advanced Programming Classes for Competitive Programming <br />
                3. Web Development Course</p>
            
            <h4 className='text-success'>Basic C Programming Course for Beginners:</h4>

            <p>The basic C programming learning course held by MCC for the fresh new students is taken by the very diligent and devoted mentor Swapnil Biswas of CSE 16. Under his administration the students of CSE 20 are performing very well and they seem to love the classes and programming. Responses to these classes are overwhelming and they are also doing well on the online contests. Now, Mentor Swapnil Biswas has planned to divide them into teams to create an environment to have the taste of team contesting and build up a good relationship between them as a team. Besides those who are making quick progress, a separate class is taken by Lec Muhaimin where advanced topics are taught. We are very hopeful to get a good result from this course and build some excellent programmers for MIST. Here are more details about their class and contest held till now.</p>
