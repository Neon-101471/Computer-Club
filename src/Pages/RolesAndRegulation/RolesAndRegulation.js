          <li>
            When there is task to be done, the assigned person doing that task
            is responsible for what he has done / is doing and should hand over
            in the completed task to the President / GS / Coordinator / Asst.
            Coordinator by the dateline. Failure in doing so, will result in
            problems or delay to the event. It is advised to cooperate with one
            another when someone ask you for help, because you might need that
            person in the future for carrying out events proposed by / assigned
            to you.
          </li>
          <li>
            All members should unite as one in order to get the best output for
            a particular event.

          <li>
            When there is a problem / task to be done, executive members should
            help each other out.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is advised that if we want to improve on the well-being and
            reputation of computer club, we should unite as one family and
            commit to the club events and everything else.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you are assigned to do a task, and you do not know what to do for
            that task, you should go back and ask the person who assign you the
            task and clarify what needs to be done for that task.
          </li>
          <li>
            Failure in doing so will result in work not done and thus slowing
            down the whole process of preparation for the event.
          </li>
          <li>
            The person who assigns the task will think that you have done the
            assigned task and when he finds out that you did not do it, this
            will in turn result in conflicts and may affect your reputation of
            the position you are holding in the committee.
          </li>
          <li>
            The person assigning the task should always check on the process of
            the task to be done periodically. You have the right to push that
            volunteer of yours to do the task in a faster rate.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you are assigned to do a task, and have finish doing it, you
            should take up the initiative to help those who have not finish
            doing it in order to speed up the process of preparation for the
            event.
          </li>
          <li>If you are not assigned to do a task, you should also take up the initiative to help out in the event. Your help is greatly appreciated and you will be rewarded ACC points accordingly.</li>
          <li>Committee members should provide their full support and help in events if there is anything requested by the Coordinator / Asst. Coordinator to be done.
